# About

# Files

- **.env**: All *.env files should be .gitignored by default since they often contain secrets. The one exception is joy.env
- **joy.env**: Contains project specific information and should NEVER contain secrets
- **README.md**: This file but also indicative of best-practice control files that should be in every Joy project
