# Joy Plugins

Currently implemented as simple require modules, the longer term intent is to publish each one as a separate NPM module. This will help encourage a Joy plugin ecosystem.

Note that the only two plugins working so far are docker and test. The other folders are either placeholder, or contain legacy .sh scripts waiting to be converted.
