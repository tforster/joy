## Installation

### Required Dependencies

- A contemporary development machine running the latest version of Linux, Windows or OSX. We recommend Windows 10 Pro with WSL2 running Ubuntu 18.04.
- NodeJS 13+: We recommend installing with [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). _Note that later versions can be used but be aware that AWS Lambda only supports features in 10.15_.
- [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/): With over 6 million downloads, the Serverless Framework is the tool developers trust to build and deploy serverless applications. The Serverless Framework supports 8 different cloud providers with a single developer experience.
- A good code editor. We strongly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Atom.
- The [Joy](https://github.com/tforster/joy) open source DevOps framework
